---

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL INTEGRATION POINTS

### **Database Schema** (Ready - No Changes Needed)
All required tables are implemented with proper RLS policies:
- `hiring_applications` - Application data with AI parsing
- `hiring_decisions` - Approval workflow with audit trail  
- `guard_profiles` - TOPS-compliant profile management
- `email_logs` - Email tracking and delivery status

### **Service Layer** (90% Complete - Minor Additions Needed)
Core services implemented, need integration:
- `KanbanWorkflowService` - Add email notification triggers
- `ApprovalWorkflowService` - Connect to approval UI components
- `GuardProfileService` - Integration with page components

### **Component Architecture** (75% Complete - Pages Needed)
Business logic components complete, need page wrappers:
- All form components implemented and tested
- Service integration components ready
- Missing: Page-level routing and authentication

## ðŸ”’ SECURITY & COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### **Immediate Security Tasks:**
1. **PII Encryption**: Implement production-grade encryption for sensitive guard data
2. **Role-Based Access**: Ensure proper authentication checks on all new pages
3. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail integration for all approval actions
4. **Digital Signatures**: Legal signature capture for hiring decisions

### **Compliance Validation:**
- TOPS regulatory compliance verification
- Email template legal review and approval
- Audit trail completeness for regulatory reporting
- Data retention policy implementation

## ðŸ“Š COMPLETION METRICS & DEFINITION OF DONE

### **Story 2.4 - Complete When:**
- [ ] All 5 email templates implemented and tested
- [ ] Email service integrated with Supabase Edge Functions
- [ ] Kanban board triggers appropriate emails on status changes
- [ ] Advanced filtering fully functional with search capabilities

## ðŸš¦ RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### **HIGH RISK - Email System Integration**
**Risk:** Supabase Edge Functions email integration complexity  
**Mitigation:** Start with mock email service, implement Supabase integration incrementally  
**Fallback:** Console logging for development, email service can be enhanced post-epic

### **MEDIUM RISK - PII Encryption Implementation**  
**Risk:** Production encryption complexity and security validation  
**Mitigation:** Use established encryption libraries, implement with security review  
**Fallback:** Development encryption with production upgrade path defined

### **LOW RISK - Page Integration**
**Risk:** Component integration with existing authentication system  
**Mitigation:** All components already built, page wrappers are straightforward implementation
