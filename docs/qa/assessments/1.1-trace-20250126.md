# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.1 - Project Infrastructure Setup

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 6
- Fully Covered: 2 (33%)
- Partially Covered: 3 (50%)
- Not Covered: 1 (17%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: Extend existing Next.js 15 application with Supabase Auth integration while maintaining static export for marketing pages

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts::should display marketing pages`
  - Given: User visits marketing pages
  - When: Pages are accessed without authentication
  - Then: Marketing content displays correctly

- **Build Test**: Build process validates static export functionality
  - Given: Next.js application with auth integration
  - When: Build command is executed
  - Then: Static marketing pages and dynamic auth routes are generated

#### AC2: Configure role-based routing that preserves public marketing routes and protects guard management routes

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **E2E Test**: `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts::should redirect to login when accessing protected route`
  - Given: Unauthenticated user
  - When: Accessing protected dashboard route
  - Then: User is redirected to login page

**Gap**: No test coverage for role-based access (admin vs manager vs guard routes)

#### AC3: Implement environment variable management for development, staging, and production environments

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **Integration**: Environment variables configured in code
- **Gap**: No automated tests validating environment variable handling

#### AC4: Set up Vercel deployment pipeline extension to handle authenticated and static content deployment

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Infrastructure**: `vercel.json` configuration validates deployment setup
- **Build Test**: Successful build indicates deployment readiness

#### AC5: Create database schema foundation with RLS policies template structure

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **Database Schema**: Migration files exist and are well-structured
- **Gap**: No automated tests validating RLS policies work correctly

#### AC6: Establish testing framework for both static and authenticated application components

**Coverage: NONE**

- **Gap**: Jest and Playwright are configured but comprehensive test suite is incomplete
- **Gap**: No integration tests for authentication flows
- **Gap**: Missing database tests using pgTAP

### Critical Gaps

1. **Role-Based Access Control Testing**
   - Gap: No tests validating different user roles can access appropriate routes
   - Risk: High - Could allow privilege escalation
   - Action: Implement comprehensive RBAC tests

2. **Database RLS Policy Testing**
   - Gap: RLS policies not validated through automated tests
   - Risk: High - Could allow unauthorized data access
   - Action: Add pgTAP tests for all RLS policies

3. **Complete Authentication Flow Testing**
   - Gap: Limited E2E tests for complete auth workflows
   - Risk: Medium - Auth edge cases untested
   - Action: Expand Playwright test coverage

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. Add comprehensive RBAC tests (unit and integration)
2. Implement pgTAP database tests for RLS policies  
3. Add integration tests for environment variable handling
4. Expand E2E test coverage for complete auth workflows

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: RBAC and RLS policy functionality (no test coverage)
- **Medium Risk**: Environment variable management (partial coverage)
- **Low Risk**: Static site functionality (full test coverage)
