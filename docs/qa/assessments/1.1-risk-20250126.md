# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-01-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Role-Based Access Control Not Implemented

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Code shows TODOs and placeholder implementation
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized access to admin/manager functions possible
**Mitigation**:

- Complete user role lookup in ProtectedRoute component
- Implement JWT claims extraction with role information
- Add role validation middleware for API routes
  **Testing Focus**: Authentication bypass tests, privilege escalation scenarios

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| SEC-001  | RBAC not implemented           | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
| SEC-002  | Missing rate limiting          | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | No auth token caching          | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Audit trail incomplete         | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| BUS-001  | Marketing site disruption     | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| OPS-001  | ESLint not configured          | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      |
| TECH-001 | Missing error boundaries       | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| SEC-003  | Console logging user data     | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Authentication bypass attempts (try accessing /dashboard without auth)
- Role escalation tests (guard trying to access admin functions)
- JWT token manipulation tests
- Middleware route protection validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Rate limiting tests for auth endpoints
- Session management and token refresh tests
- Database RLS policy validation tests

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Performance tests for auth flow
- Marketing site regression tests
- Error boundary component tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9): Complete RBAC implementation
- High risks affecting security: Rate limiting implementation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls: Performance monitoring
- Low risks with monitoring in place: Enhanced logging

### Accepted Risks

- Console logging in development (will be removed in production builds)
- ESLint configuration (can be addressed in next sprint)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Authentication failure rates and patterns (SEC risks)
- Response times for protected routes (PERF risks) 
- Failed authorization attempts (security alerts)
- Marketing site availability and performance (BUS risks)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Role-based access control is implemented
- Rate limiting middleware is added
- Performance issues are reported in auth flow
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered in Supabase auth
