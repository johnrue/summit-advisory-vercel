    status: FAILED
    notes: "TypeScript compilation produces 200+ errors. 'pnpm run type-check' fails with extensive type conflicts across test files, service layer, and component interfaces."
    evidence: "Live validation shows continued errors in __tests__, lib/services, and component files despite claimed resolution."

    status: PARTIAL
    notes: "Some foundation layer work completed (centralized enums in lib/types.ts) but service layer, API routes, and presentation layer issues remain unresolved."
    evidence: "Core type definitions improved but systematic resolution incomplete across dependency layers."
  
  ac3_functional_compatibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Marketing site and guard management functionality preserved. Production build succeeds with 117 static pages generated."
    evidence: "Build process completes successfully with warnings but no functionality breaks."
  
  ac4_type_safety_standards:
    status: FAILED
    notes: "Type safety standards compromised by build configuration that ignores TypeScript errors rather than establishing proper type constraints."
    evidence: "next.config.mjs uses 'ignoreBuildErrors: true' which bypasses type checking rather than ensuring type safety."

conclusion: |
  While Story 0.1 enables production deployment through build configuration changes, it fundamentally fails to meet its core acceptance criteria of achieving zero TypeScript errors. The implementation uses a workaround (ignoring build errors) rather than systematic error resolution. This creates technical debt and compromises the type safety foundation needed for reliable development and maintenance.
