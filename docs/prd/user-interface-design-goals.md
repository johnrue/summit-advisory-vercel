# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Professional, security-industry focused interface that prioritizes efficiency and compliance confidence. The design should feel enterprise-grade yet approachable, reducing cognitive load for managers handling multiple complex workflows while providing guards with simple, mobile-first interactions. Interface should convey trust, accountability, and operational precision befitting a security services platform.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Kanban-driven workflow management**: Visual boards for hiring, shifts, contracts, and projects with drag-and-drop functionality and clear status progression
- **Role-switching dashboard design**: Managers need unified interfaces that allow them to seamlessly switch between hiring, scheduling, sales, and compliance functions rather than specialized role-based applications
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex guard profiles and detailed workflows revealed progressively to avoid overwhelming users
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Touch-friendly interactions with large tap targets for guards accessing via smartphones

## Core Screens and Views
- **Unified Manager Dashboard**: Single dashboard that surfaces urgent items across hiring, scheduling, sales, and compliance with context-switching capabilities
- **Multi-function Kanban Interface**: Tabbed or filtered view allowing managers to work with Hiring, Shifts, Contracts, and Internal Projects from the same interface
- **Guard Profile Management**: Comprehensive profile editor with TOPS compliance indicators and document upload
- **Calendar View**: Master calendar with role-based filtering and availability management
- **Compliance Reports Dashboard**: TOPS export generation and audit log access
- **Guard Mobile Portal**: Simplified shift acceptance, availability setting, and profile management
- **Lead Capture Forms**: Minimal friction forms for both client and guard lead generation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Platform must meet WCAG AA standards for accessibility, ensuring compliance with ADA requirements and supporting assistive technologies for all user roles.

## Branding
Extend existing Summit Advisory brand identity with professional security industry aesthetics. Leverage current warm metallic gold primary colors, charcoal backgrounds, and clean typography while adding operational interface elements (status indicators, priority badges, compliance icons) that convey security industry professionalism and regulatory rigor.

**Logo Implementation**: Consistently use the official Summit Advisory logo (https://summitadvisoryfirm.com/saf-logo-cropped.png) throughout the platform:
- **Navigation header**: Logo in top-left corner with link to main dashboard
- **Login/Authentication pages**: Centered logo above login forms
- **Dashboard headers**: Logo integrated into role-specific dashboard layouts
- **Email templates**: Logo in email headers for all automated notifications
- **Compliance reports**: Official letterhead with logo for TOPS exports
- **Mobile interface**: Appropriately sized logo for mobile navigation
- **Loading screens**: Logo displayed during page transitions and data processing
- **Print materials**: Logo included in any printable documents or reports

**Logo Usage Guidelines**:
- Maintain proper aspect ratio and minimum size requirements
- Use high-resolution PNG format for web display
- Ensure adequate white space/padding around logo
- Consider dark/light theme variations if needed for visibility

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on responsive web application compatible with desktop browsers for managers and mobile browsers for guards. Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile installation and offline functionality during shifts.
