2. Implement automated report generation triggered by date ranges and compliance deadlines
3. Configure sensitive data masking in reports based on user role permissions (SSN visible only to Manager/Admin)
4. Create exportable report formats (PDF, CSV) with official letterhead and compliance attestations
5. Implement report scheduling system with automatic delivery to compliance stakeholders
6. Configure report audit trail tracking who generated reports and when for accountability

## Story 4.3: Certification Expiry Management
As a manager,
I want automated tracking and alerts for expiring guard certifications,
so that I can ensure continuous compliance and prevent scheduling guards with expired credentials while managing multiple operational priorities.

5. Create compliance dashboard showing all guards with upcoming certification expirations
6. Configure escalation notifications to management for guards who fail to renew certifications

## Story 4.4: Comprehensive Notification System
As a guard or manager,
I want to receive timely, relevant notifications about assignments, deadlines, and important updates,
so that I can stay informed and respond appropriately to operational needs and compliance requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
