# Epic 0: Technical Debt Resolution & Stabilization

## Epic Goal
Systematically resolve all TypeScript errors and replace mock data with live backend integrations to achieve production-ready code quality, establishing the stable foundation required for all other Guard Management Platform features.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context:
- **Current Status:** All 5 Guard Management Platform epics marked "Complete" but built on unstable foundation
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5, Supabase, Vercel deployment
- **Critical Issues:** ~400 TypeScript compilation errors, 60+ files with hardcoded mock data
- **Impact:** Platform appears functional but is unfit for production deployment

### Enhancement Details:
- **What's being fixed:** TypeScript type safety, mock data replacement, test suite restoration
- **How it stabilizes:** Systematic error resolution in dependency order (types → services → API → UI)
- **Success criteria:** Zero compilation errors, zero mock data, 100% functional test suite

## Stories

### Story 0.1: TypeScript Error Systematic Resolution
**Priority:** P0 (Foundation)
**Description:** Fix all ~400 TypeScript compilation errors using phased approach starting with core type definitions and working through dependency layers.

**Phase Structure:**
1. Fix type definitions in `lib/types/` (foundation layer)
2. Fix services in `lib/services/` (business logic layer) 
3. Fix API routes in `app/api/` (integration layer)
4. Fix components and dashboard UI (presentation layer)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `pnpm run type-check` passes with zero errors
- All generated `.next/types/` files compile successfully
- No TypeScript errors in IDE or CI/CD pipeline

### Story 0.2: Mock Data Integration Replacement
**Priority:** P0 (Backend Integration)
**Description:** Replace all 60+ identified mock data instances with live Supabase backend integrations.

**Target Scope:**
- All API routes currently returning placeholder responses
- All components using hardcoded mock data arrays
- All files with "Mock data", "placeholder", "// For now" comments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API endpoints return live data from Supabase
- All components consume real backend services
- Zero hardcoded mock data in production code paths
- All CRUD operations functional with database persistence

### Story 0.3: Test Suite Restoration & Validation
**Priority:** P0 (Quality Assurance)
**Description:** Fix all test suite TypeScript errors making automated testing functional and establishing quality gates.

**Scope:**
- Fix TypeScript errors in all `__tests__/` directories
- Restore CI/CD pipeline functionality
- Establish test coverage baselines

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `pnpm run test` passes for entire test suite
- CI/CD pipeline functional with automated test validation
- Test coverage metrics available and tracked
- All critical user workflows have functional E2E tests

### Story 0.4: Production Readiness Gate Implementation
**Priority:** P0 (Deployment Validation)
**Description:** Validate full application deployment and functionality, establishing quality gates for future development.

**Scope:**
- Complete end-to-end production deployment validation
- Performance benchmarking against NFR requirements
- Quality gate documentation and enforcement

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successful production deployment with zero errors
- All user flows functional end-to-end
- Performance benchmarks meet NFR requirements (sub-2s load times, 99.5% uptime)
- Quality gates documented for future development

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Existing APIs remain unchanged:** All marketing site functionality preserved
- [x] **Database schema compatibility:** Additive changes only to existing consultation_requests table
- [x] **UI patterns consistency:** Follow existing shadcn/ui component patterns and design system
- [x] **Performance impact:** No degradation to marketing site static export performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk
**Breaking existing marketing site functionality** during Guard Management Platform stabilization

### Mitigation Strategy
- **Isolated work areas:** Focus on `/dashboard`, `/app/api/v1/`, guard-specific services only
- **Automated testing:** Comprehensive regression testing of marketing functionality
- **Incremental deployment:** Story-by-story validation with rollback capability

### Rollback Plan
- **Git-based rollback:** Each story commits can be reverted independently
- **Feature flags:** Guard management features can be disabled without affecting marketing site
- **Database isolation:** Marketing consultation_requests table remains untouched

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Story 0.1 Complete:** Zero TypeScript compilation errors across entire codebase
- [ ] **Story 0.2 Complete:** Zero mock data in production code paths, all integrations functional
- [ ] **Story 0.3 Complete:** 100% functional test suite with CI/CD integration
- [ ] **Story 0.4 Complete:** Production deployment validated with performance benchmarks met
- [ ] **Existing functionality verified:** All marketing site features working unchanged
- [ ] **Integration points working:** Authentication, database, and API layers stable
- [ ] **Documentation updated:** Technical debt resolution process documented
- [ ] **Quality gates established:** Standards documented to prevent future technical debt

## Timeline & Resource Allocation

**Duration:** 2-3 sprints (high-intensity focused development)
**Resources:** Primary development agent with QA validation at each story completion
**Dependencies:** None - can begin immediately
**Blocks Removed:** Epic 1-5 re-validation can proceed after Epic 0 completion
