# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Transform guard operations from manual/fragmented processes to integrated, compliance-first digital platform
- Reduce hiring cycle time by 40% through automated workflows and audit trails
- Achieve 100% TOPS compliance audit pass rate with zero violations  
- Decrease scheduling conflicts by 75% through automated conflict detection and calendar integration
- Improve guard application completion rate to 85% (from estimated 45%) via streamlined mobile-friendly workflows
- Scale operations to manage 200+ guards without proportional administrative overhead increase
- Eliminate manual data entry errors for certifications, availability, and compliance tracking

## Background Context

Security companies currently manage guard operations through fragmented systems involving spreadsheets, manual processes, and disconnected tools, leading to significant operational inefficiencies and compliance risks. Summit Advisory faces the same challenges: high application dropoff, manual hiring workflows without audit trails, scheduling conflicts from lack of centralized management, and compliance gaps where TOPS regulatory requirements are met through manual tracking that creates audit risks.

The Summit Advisory Guard Management Platform addresses these critical gaps by providing a comprehensive, TOPS-native compliance solution that manages the complete guard lifecycle through a unified web application. Built specifically for the Texas security industry, this platform uses Kanban-driven workflow management with automated compliance tracking, audit-first architecture, and security-by-design principles to enable enterprise-grade efficiency while maintaining full regulatory compliance.
