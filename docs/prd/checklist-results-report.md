## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- **TOPS Compliance Validation**: Legal review required to confirm regulatory requirements are accurately captured
- **Background Check API Research**: Need to identify current vendor capabilities and integration complexity

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- **Calendar Sync Security**: Need detailed OAuth scope definition and permission filtering architecture
- **Supabase Scaling Validation**: Confirm real-time capabilities can handle 200+ concurrent users

**LOW Priority:**
- **Load Testing Plan**: Define performance benchmarks and testing approach
- **Mobile PWA Strategy**: Clarify offline capabilities and installation approach

## MVP Scope Assessment
**Appropriate Scope**: The 5-epic structure delivers complete operational capability while remaining achievable. Each epic provides substantial value and can be deployed incrementally.

**Potential Scope Reductions** (if timeline pressure):
- Epic 5 (Lead Generation) could be deferred since Epic 2-4 deliver core guard management
- Calendar sync could be simplified to export-only initially
- Advanced reporting could be reduced to basic TOPS compliance exports

## Technical Readiness
**Architecture Foundation**: Strong technical assumptions leveraging existing Summit Advisory infrastructure. Clear technology choices with rationale.

**Areas for Architect Investigation**:
- Real-time notification architecture and scaling
- File upload security and virus scanning implementation  
- Calendar OAuth integration complexity and security model
- Audit logging performance with large datasets

## Recommendations

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Legal Validation**: Schedule TOPS compliance review with qualified counsel before architecture phase
2. **Vendor Research**: Identify background check vendor APIs and integration patterns
3. **Infrastructure Assessment**: Validate Supabase scaling for real-time features with 200+ users

**Next Steps:**
1. **Architect Handoff**: Provide PRD to Architect with specific focus areas
2. **UX Expert Consultation**: Begin interface design based on corrected role structure

**FINAL DECISION: READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design with noted areas for validation.
