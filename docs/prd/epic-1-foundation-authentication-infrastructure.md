# Epic 1 Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish secure, role-based authentication system and project infrastructure that enables guard management functionality while maintaining existing marketing site capabilities. This epic delivers the security foundation, role-specific dashboards, and admin impersonation capabilities required for all subsequent guard workforce operations.

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
As a developer,
I want to extend the existing Summit Advisory Next.js application with authentication capabilities,
so that the platform can support secure guard management features while preserving marketing site functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend existing Next.js 15 application with Supabase Auth integration while maintaining static export for marketing pages
2. Configure role-based routing that preserves public marketing routes and protects guard management routes
3. Implement environment variable management for development, staging, and production environments
4. Set up Vercel deployment pipeline extension to handle authenticated and static content deployment
5. Create database schema foundation with RLS policies template structure
6. Establish testing framework for both static and authenticated application components

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System
As a manager or guard,
I want to securely log into the platform with appropriate access levels,
so that I can access role-specific functionality while ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Supabase Auth login/logout with email and password authentication
2. Configure password policy with minimum complexity requirements and rate limiting
3. Create role assignment system (Guard, Manager, Admin) with Supabase RLS integration
4. Implement session management with secure token handling and automatic logout
5. Provide password reset functionality with secure email verification flow

**Note**: MFA enforcement will be added in a future enhancement phase after initial development and testing is complete.

## Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control
As an administrator,
I want to manage user roles and permissions,
so that guards only access their data while managers have operational visibility and admins have full platform access.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create user roles table with Guard, Manager, Admin roles and permission matrices
2. Implement RLS policies that enforce data access based on user roles and organizational boundaries
3. Create role assignment interface for admins to manage user permissions
4. Configure navigation and UI elements to show/hide based on user role permissions
5. Implement audit logging for role changes and permission elevation actions
6. Test role enforcement across all planned application routes and data access patterns

## Story 1.4: Role-Specific Dashboard Framework
As a user (guard, manager, or admin),
I want to access a role-appropriate dashboard when I log in,
so that I can quickly see relevant information and access key functions specific to my role and responsibilities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create **admin dashboard** with system overview, user management, role assignments, and platform analytics
2. Create **manager dashboard** template with widgets for urgent items, operational metrics, and quick actions
3. Create **guard dashboard** template with personal schedule, assignments, and profile access
4. Implement dashboard personalization for widget arrangement and display preferences
5. Configure dashboard routing based on user role with appropriate default landing pages
6. Create navigation framework that supports both authenticated and public site sections
7. Implement responsive design that works on desktop (managers/admins) and mobile (guards)
8. Add role indicator and quick stats relevant to each user type

## Story 1.5: Admin User Impersonation & Role Switching
As an administrator,
I want to switch between user roles and impersonate other users to troubleshoot issues and make necessary adjustments,
so that I can provide effective support and system administration without requiring separate admin-only interfaces for every function.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Role Switching Interface**: Create admin-only role switcher that allows switching between Admin, Manager, and Guard views
2. **User Impersonation System**: Enable admins to impersonate specific users (with their permission level) to troubleshoot account issues
3. **Audit Trail for Impersonation**: Log all impersonation sessions with start/end times, actions taken, and admin identity
4. **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI indicators when admin is in impersonation mode or switched role view
5. **Permission Preservation**: Ensure impersonated sessions respect the target user's actual permissions and data access
6. **Emergency Exit**: Always-available "Return to Admin" button/link during impersonation sessions
7. **Session Management**: Automatic logout from impersonation after configurable timeout (default 30 minutes)
8. **Impersonation Consent**: Notification system to inform users when their account has been accessed by admin (configurable)
9. **Role View Persistence**: Remember admin's preferred role view (but not impersonation) across sessions
10. **Dashboard Context Switching**: Seamlessly switch between admin, manager, and guard dashboard contexts without losing admin privileges
