2. Implement time-off request system with manager approval workflow and conflict checking
3. Configure recurring availability patterns with override capabilities for specific dates
4. Create emergency unavailability reporting with immediate manager notification and replacement suggestions
5. Implement availability history tracking and pattern analysis for scheduling optimization
6. Configure availability export for personal calendar integration and shift planning

## Story 3.4: Shift Kanban Board
As a manager,
I want to visualize and manage all shifts through a Kanban workflow,
so that I can track shift status, identify staffing gaps, and ensure operational coverage.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create Shift Kanban board with columns: Unassigned → Assigned → Confirmed → In Progress → Completed → Issue Logged
2. Implement visual indicators for shift priority, required certifications, and staffing status
3. Configure filtering by date range, client, site, guard, and certification requirements
4. Create bulk operations for common actions like assignment, confirmation, and status updates
5. Implement urgent shift alerts for unstaffed positions within 24 hours of start time
6. Configure shift archival system for completed shifts with historical reporting access

## Story 3.5: Calendar Integration System
As a manager or guard,
I want calendar integration with external calendar providers,
so that I can sync my work schedule with personal calendars while maintaining appropriate privacy and security whether I'm managing operations or working shifts.

### Acceptance Criteria

2. Create role-based calendar export filtering that only includes events user is authorized to view
3. Configure one-way sync (export only) to prevent external calendar changes from affecting platform data
4. Implement calendar sync status monitoring with error handling and retry mechanisms
5. Create sync preference management allowing users to control which events are exported
6. Configure timezone handling for calendar events with local time display and UTC storage

## Story 3.6: Real-time Schedule Updates
As a guard or manager,
I want to receive immediate notifications of schedule changes,
so that I can respond quickly to shift assignments, cancellations, and urgent coverage needs.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement real-time notification system using Supabase subscriptions for schedule changes
2. Create in-app notification interface with unread counts and action buttons for quick responses
3. Configure email notifications for critical schedule changes with mobile-optimized templates
4. Implement notification preferences allowing users to control frequency and delivery methods
5. Create notification history and acknowledgment tracking for accountability purposes
6. Configure emergency notification escalation for urgent shift coverage requirements
