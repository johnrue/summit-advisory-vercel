# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

Create the first implementation story focusing on authentication infrastructure:

**Story: Authentication System Foundation**
- Reference this architecture document for technical decisions
- Implement dual Supabase client configuration (public/authenticated)
- Set up basic role-based dashboard structure with route groups
- Create authentication middleware for route protection
- Establish user role management with Supabase RLS policies
- Verify integration doesn't affect existing marketing site functionality

**Integration Checkpoints:**
- Marketing site remains fully functional during development
- Authentication boundaries properly isolate public and private features
- Database migrations are additive-only with zero downtime
- All new code follows existing TypeScript and component patterns

## Developer Handoff

**Technical Implementation Guide:**
- Follow this architecture document for all technical decisions
- Use existing coding standards with TypeScript strict mode
- Implement components using established shadcn/ui patterns
- Follow existing service layer architecture (consultation-service.ts pattern)
- Ensure all database operations include proper RLS policies and audit logging
- Maintain existing build and deployment processes during development

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Preserve marketing site performance (static export)
- Follow existing TypeScript interfaces and error handling patterns
- Use established React Hook Form + Zod validation approach
- Implement proper security boundaries between marketing and guard management
- Ensure real-time features degrade gracefully without JavaScript

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1:** Authentication infrastructure and basic dashboard routing
2. **Phase 2:** Guard profile management with document upload
3. **Phase 3:** Hiring pipeline Kanban with AI resume parsing
4. **Phase 4:** Shift management and calendar integration
5. **Phase 5:** Compliance reporting and audit dashboard
