3. **Provide AI-parsed data review**: Allow applicants to review, edit, and confirm AI-extracted information before submission
4. Implement client-side validation and progress saving to prevent data loss
5. Configure secure document upload (PDF/DOCX) with file type validation and virus scanning
6. Store application data with timestamps and automatically transition lead to "Application Received" status
7. Send confirmation email to applicant with application reference number and next steps
8. Create application review interface showing submitted documents, applicant information, and AI-parsed data confidence scores

```

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Lead Capture Extension** [Source: Story 2.1 completion with authentication fixes]:
- Extend existing guard_leads table rather than creating new application table
- Use existing application_link_token system for secure access
- Build on existing lead management interface for application review  
- Follow resolved authentication patterns from 2.1 (enhanced useUserRole hook)
- Apply RLS policy patterns that avoid circular dependencies from 2.1 resolution
- Use JWT-based role checking instead of complex EXISTS queries for better performance

**Document Storage Integration** [Source: existing Supabase configuration]:
- Use Supabase Storage for secure document handling
- Implement RLS policies for document access control
- Follow existing file upload patterns from consultation attachments
- Integrate with existing email service for confirmation notifications

### Security Considerations

**Document Security** [Source: architecture/security-integration.md]:
- All document uploads require virus scanning before storage
- PDF/DOCX files only - strict file type validation
- Documents stored in private Supabase Storage bucket with RLS policies
- Secure document access URLs with time-limited tokens
- AI processing occurs in secure Edge Functions with no permanent storage

**Data Protection**:
- Application data encrypted at rest in Supabase
- AI-parsed data includes confidence indicators for human review
- Personal information (DOB, SSN) handled with enhanced security measures
- Audit trail for all AI processing and data access events

**Access Control**:
- Applicants can only access their own applications via secure tokens
- Managers require authentication and role-based permissions
- Document access controlled by RLS policies and signed URLs
- AI processing rate-limited to prevent abuse

### UI Color Enhancement Requirements

**Color Palette Improvements** [Source: Screenshot analysis and existing brand colors from CLAUDE.md]:
```css
/* Enhanced CSS Variables - Maintaining Brand Colors with Better Contrast */
:root {
  /* Light theme - clean, professional appearance */
  --background: 0 0% 100%;           /* Pure white background */
  --foreground: 0 0% 10%;            /* Strong black text for contrast */
  
  /* Enhanced cards with better definition */
  --card: 0 0% 98%;                  /* Slightly off-white cards for subtle definition */
  --card-foreground: 0 0% 10%;       /* Dark text on light cards */
  
  /* Brand colors maintained - Warm metallic gold & Burnt bronze */
  --primary: 43 22% 51%;             /* Warm metallic gold (brand color) */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 98%;    /* Light text on gold */
  
  --accent: 30 21% 40%;              /* Burnt bronze (brand color) */
  --accent-foreground: 0 0% 98%;     /* Light text on bronze */
  
  /* Improved borders and interactive elements */
  --border: 43 22% 85%;              /* Subtle gold-tinted borders */
  --muted: 40 6% 95%;                /* Light muted background */
  --muted-foreground: 0 0% 40%;      /* Readable muted text */
  
  /* Enhanced status colors for better visibility */
  --success: 142 76% 36%;            /* Professional green */
  --warning: 38 92% 50%;             /* Clear orange */
  --destructive: 0 72% 51%;          /* Alert red */
}

.dark {
  /* Dark theme - maintaining brand's charcoal/gold aesthetic */
  --background: 0 0% 10%;            /* Charcoal black (brand color) */
  --foreground: 40 6% 86%;           /* Ash grey (brand color) */
  
  /* Enhanced dark cards with better definition */
  --card: 0 0% 15%;                  /* Slightly lighter than background for definition */
  --card-foreground: 40 6% 86%;      /* Ash grey text */
  
  /* Brand colors maintained */
  --primary: 43 22% 51%;             /* Warm metallic gold (brand color) */
  --primary-foreground: 0 0% 10%;    /* Dark text on gold */
  
  --accent: 30 21% 40%;              /* Burnt bronze (brand color) */
  --accent-foreground: 0 0% 98%;     /* Light text on bronze */
  
  /* Improved dark mode elements */
  --border: 43 22% 25%;              /* Subtle gold-tinted borders */
  --muted: 0 0% 20%;                 /* Darker muted background */
  --muted-foreground: 40 6% 65%;     /* Readable muted text */
}
```

**Brand-Aligned Enhancement Strategy**:
- **Preserves Core Brand Identity**: Maintains Summit Advisory's warm metallic gold and burnt bronze
- **Improves Visual Hierarchy**: Cards now have subtle definition instead of washed-out appearance  
- **Enhances Contrast**: Text contrast meets WCAG AA standards while keeping brand aesthetic
- **Professional Polish**: Status indicators and interactive elements are crisp and clear
- **Consistent Theme Support**: Both light and dark modes maintain brand coherence
