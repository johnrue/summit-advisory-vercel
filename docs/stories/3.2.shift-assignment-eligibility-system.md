## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 3.1: Shift Creation & Management**
- Shifts table established with `assigned_guard_id` field ready for assignment
- Epic 2 integration foundation with guard_profiles certification validation 
- Database schema includes `required_certifications` JSONB field for eligibility matching
- Service layer patterns established with ServiceResult error handling
- RLS policies configured for manager permissions and guard access

**Key Technical Foundations:**
- Guard eligibility validation function `validate_guard_shift_eligibility()` already designed in 3.1
- Integration patterns with Epic 2 guard_profiles table established
- Audit trail patterns with manager accountability in place

### Epic 2 Integration Requirements
**Guard Profile Dependencies** [Source: Story 3.1 Epic 2 Integration]
- **Guard Eligibility**: Must check `guard_profiles.profile_status = 'approved'` and `is_schedulable = TRUE`
- **Certification Validation**: Validate against `guard_profiles.certification_status` JSONB field
- **TOPS Compliance**: Required certifications must match active certifications from Epic 2 data
- **Manager Permissions**: Assignment restricted to users with `role = 'manager'` or `'admin'` from Epic 2 RBAC

**Required Integration Functions:**
```sql
-- From Story 3.1 - Already designed
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.validate_guard_shift_eligibility(
    guard_id UUID,
    required_certs JSONB
) RETURNS BOOLEAN;
