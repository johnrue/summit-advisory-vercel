# Story 0.4: Production Readiness Gate Implementation

## Status
üü¢ **Approved** - Story validated and ready for hybrid AWS implementation. Technical specifications complete with AWS MCP integration, budget-conscious deployment strategy, and comprehensive quality gates for EC2/ALB production deployment.

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to validate full hybrid architecture deployment functionality with repository separation and establish comprehensive quality gates for production readiness,

**From Story 0.2 (Mock Data Integration Replacement):**
- Comprehensive Supabase integration implemented with live backend
- All major service layers connected to database with proper error handling
- Authentication system functional with role-based access control
- **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: Production mock data removed, test mock data preserved

**From Story 0.3 (Test Suite Restoration & Validation):**
- Jest + React Testing Library framework fully operational
- 117+ test files converted and functional with proper mock data
- CI/CD pipeline foundation established
- **IMPORTANT**: Test mock data properly maintained for testing purposes

### Production Mock Data Assessment
**CRITICAL GUIDANCE FOR DEVELOPERS:**

üö® **DO NOT REMOVE MOCK DATA FROM TEST FILES** üö®
- **Preserve ALL mock data in `__tests__/` directories**
- **Preserve ALL test fixtures and mock services in `tests/` directories**  
- **Preserve ALL Jest mock functions and test data**

‚úÖ **REMOVE ONLY PRODUCTION MOCK DATA:**
- Hardcoded mock responses in `app/api/` routes
- Mock data arrays in production components
- Placeholder implementations in `lib/services/` (production code only)
- "// For now" comments and temporary implementations in production code

**Mock Data Validation Strategy:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: These should contain mock data for testing
__tests__/**/*.test.ts
__tests__/**/*.test.tsx  
tests/**/*.spec.ts
jest.setup.ts
playwright.config.ts

# ‚ùå REMOVE: These should NOT contain mock data in production
app/api/v1/**/*.ts (production API routes)
lib/services/**/*.ts (business logic services) 
components/dashboard/**/*.tsx (production components)
```

### AWS MCP Integration and Tooling
[Source: AWS MCP setup completion - 2025-09-04]

**Available AWS MCP Tools:**
- ‚úÖ AWS CLI configured (credentials in ~/.aws/, region us-east-1)
- ‚úÖ MCP servers: awslabs serverless/docs/core (via uv) + community servers (via npm)
- ‚úÖ Configuration: .claude/mcp-servers.json
- ‚úÖ Documentation: Created in docs/ folder

**MCP-Enabled Deployment Strategy:**
- Use AWS MCP for infrastructure deployment validation
- Leverage MCP tools for EC2/ALB setup automation
- Utilize AWS documentation MCP for best practices lookup
- Apply MCP for cost monitoring and budget optimization

**Budget-Conscious AWS Architecture:**
- EC2 Instance Types: t3.micro for development, t3.small for production (cost-optimized)
- ALB Configuration: Basic Application Load Balancer with essential health checks only
- Route53: Simple DNS routing to minimize costs
- CloudWatch: Essential monitoring with cost-efficient log retention policies
- Auto-scaling: Conservative policies with strict cost limits
- Billing Alerts: Multi-tier alerts ($50, $100, $200) with automated cost notifications
- Reserved Instances: Consider 1-year reserved instances if usage patterns stabilize

### Technical Constraints and Integration Rules
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- **Existing API Compatibility**: All marketing site functionality preserved
- **Database Integration**: Additive schema changes only, zero breaking changes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ServiceResult pattern throughout
- **Logging Consistency**: Unified logging format for all operations

**Quality Gates:**
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security validation complete
- Rollback procedures tested

### Rollback and Risk Mitigation
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md]

**Rollback Strategy:**
- **Marketing Site**: Amplify instant rollback to previous commit
- **SaaS Platform**: EC2 application rollback via PM2 process management
- **Database**: Supabase migration rollback with data preservation
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform state rollback for AWS resources

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Marketing Site Always Available**: Amplify ensures primary domain stays operational
- **Graceful SaaS Degradation**: 404 fallback when app.summitadvisoryfirm.com unavailable
- **Database Backup**: Automated Supabase backups before major changes
- **Multi-Platform Monitoring**: Independent health checks for each platform
- **Cross-Domain Session Management**: Secure authentication across domains

## Testing
