## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 3.2: Shift Assignment & Eligibility System**
- `guard_availability` table foundation already established with TSTZRANGE availability windows
- Availability type enums defined: 'available', 'unavailable', 'preferred', 'emergency_only'
- Availability status enums: 'active', 'inactive', 'archived'
- Guard eligibility integration patterns established with Epic 2 guard_profiles

**Key Technical Foundations:**
- Assignment system integration ready for availability-based conflict detection
- Epic 2 guard authentication and role-based access patterns established
- ServiceResult error handling pattern consistent across Stories 3.1 and 3.2

### Epic 2 Integration Requirements
**Guard Profile Dependencies** [Source: Stories 3.1 & 3.2]
- **Guard Authentication**: Must integrate with Epic 2 guard user accounts and authentication
- **Profile Access**: Guards can only manage their own availability (guard_profiles.user_id = auth.uid())
- **Manager Oversight**: Managers can view and approve availability requests per Epic 2 RBAC
- **Dashboard Integration**: Extends Epic 2 guard dashboard structure with availability management

### Data Models Extensions
**Time-Off Request System:**
```sql

### Business Logic Integration
**Conflict Detection Integration with Stories 3.1 & 3.2:**
- Time-off requests must check against existing shift assignments
- Emergency unavailability triggers replacement suggestions using Story 3.2 matching
- Availability patterns integrate with Story 3.2 guard eligibility scoring
- Manager approval workflow follows Epic 2 audit trail patterns

**Analytics and Optimization:**
- Availability pattern analysis for scheduling optimization
- Assignment acceptance rate correlation with availability preferences
- Team availability gap analysis for workforce planning
- Guard satisfaction metrics based on availability vs assignment matching

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Consistency** [Source: Epic architecture alignment]
- React 19 with TypeScript 5 maintaining strict mode compliance
- Next.js 15.3.5 App Router with guard-specific route groups
- Supabase real-time for availability updates and conflict notifications
- date-fns for availability window calculations and recurring pattern generation

**Integration Requirements:**
- Epic 2 guard authentication and profile integration
- Stories 3.1 & 3.2 shift and assignment system integration
- RLS policies ensuring guards can only manage their own availability
- Manager approval workflows consistent with Epic 2 approval patterns

### Testing
**Testing Framework** [Source: Epic testing strategy]

1. **LOW PRIORITY** - Time-Off Request UI Completion
   - **Finding**: Time-off request system has complete backend implementation but UI tabs need completion
   - **Impact**: Guards cannot fully manage time-off requests through the interface
   - **Mitigation**: Service layer complete, UI completion is straightforward development task

2. **LOW PRIORITY** - Manager Approval Workflow Integration
   - **Finding**: Manager approval workflow has foundation but needs integration completion
   - **Impact**: Time-off approval process requires manual manager notification setup
   - **Mitigation**: Service architecture prepared for immediate manager workflow integration
