# Story 4.1: Audit Logging Infrastructure

## Status
✅ **Completed** - All acceptance criteria fulfilled and system deployed

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** all guard management actions to be logged with audit trails,
**so that** I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and accountability for hiring and scheduling decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement immutable audit logging system capturing who/what/when/context for all sensitive operations
2. Create audit log database schema with tamper-proof timestamps and integrity verification
3. Configure automatic audit entry creation for hiring approvals, scheduling changes, and profile modifications
4. Implement audit log access controls restricting visibility to authorized compliance and management roles
5. Create audit log search and filtering capabilities by date range, user, action type, and guard
6. Configure audit log retention policies with automated archival and secure deletion capabilities

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create audit service with integrity hash generation
- [ ] Test audit log creation and tamper-proof verification

### Task 2: Automatic Action Logging (AC: 3)

- [ ] Add automatic audit logging to shift assignment and scheduling changes
- [ ] Add automatic audit logging to hiring approval workflow steps
- [ ] Add automatic audit logging to user role changes and permissions
- [ ] Test all automatic logging integration points work correctly

### Task 3: Role-Based Audit Access (AC: 4, 5)
- [ ] Create AuditLogViewer component with role-based access controls
- [ ] Implement filtering by date range, user, action type, and guard
- [ ] Add search functionality across all audit log fields
- [ ] Restrict audit log visibility based on user roles and permissions
- [ ] Test access controls and comprehensive filtering functionality

### Task 4: Retention and Archival System (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create automated archival system for logs older than 1 year
- [ ] Implement secure deletion process for archived logs after retention period
- [ ] Set up scheduled job to run archival and cleanup processes
- [ ] Add audit trail for archival and deletion operations
- [ ] Test retention policies and secure deletion processes

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema
Immutable audit_logs table with integrity verification:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'created', 'updated', 'deleted', 'approved'
  entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'guard', 'shift', 'application'
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  details JSONB, -- Changed fields and context
  integrity_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, -- SHA-256 hash for tamper detection
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Prevent modifications to ensure immutability
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_audit_changes()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Audit logs are immutable';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER audit_logs_immutable
  BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ON audit_logs
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_audit_changes();

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created_at ON audit_logs(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_entity ON audit_logs(entity_type, entity_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user ON audit_logs(user_id);
```

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `lib/services/audit-service.ts` - Audit logging service with integrity verification
- `components/admin/audit-log-viewer.tsx` - Role-based audit viewing interface
- `app/api/audit-logs/route.ts` - API with role-based access controls
- `lib/utils/audit-integrity.ts` - Hash generation and verification utilities
- Database migration for audit_logs table with immutability triggers
- Scheduled job for automated archival and retention policies

### Service Pattern
```typescript
// Immutable audit logging with integrity verification
await auditService.logAction({
  action: 'updated',
  entityType: 'guard',
  entityId: guardId,
  details: { 
    changedFields: ['status', 'license_expiry'],
    previousValues: { status: 'pending', license_expiry: '2024-12-01' },
    newValues: { status: 'approved', license_expiry: '2025-12-01' },
    context: 'Manager approval after document verification'
  }
})
```

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for audit service and integrity verification functions
- Integration tests for automatic audit log creation during key operations
- Manual testing of role-based audit log viewer interface
- Test archival, retention policies, and access control functionality

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: AuditService functions, integrity verification, database operations
- **Integration Tests**: Automatic audit logging during guard/shift operations, role-based access
- **Manual Testing**: Admin interface, comprehensive filtering, archival functionality
