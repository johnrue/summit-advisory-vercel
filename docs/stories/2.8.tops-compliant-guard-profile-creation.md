# Story 2.8: TOPS-Compliant Guard Profile Creation

## Story Overview
As an approved guard applicant, I want to complete my official guard profile with all required TOPS-compliant information, so that I can become an active, schedulable guard while ensuring Summit Advisory maintains full regulatory compliance with Texas Department of Public Safety requirements.

## User Story
**As an** approved guard applicant  
**I want to** complete my official guard profile with all required TOPS-compliant information  
**So that** I can become an active, schedulable guard while ensuring company compliance with regulations

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Create Comprehensive TOPS-Compliant Guard Profile Form
**Given** I am an approved guard applicant with a secure profile creation link  
**When** I access the guard profile creation form  
**Then** I should see a comprehensive form with all required TOPS fields and data validation:

**Required TOPS Fields:**
- Full Legal Name (with validation against government ID requirements)
- Date of Birth (encrypted storage with format validation)
- Place of Birth (text field with location validation)
- Last Six Digits of SSN (encrypted storage with partial masking display)
- Company (Summit Advisory pre-filled, non-editable)
- Current Residential Address (with address validation and autocomplete)
- Recent Photograph Upload (with file size and format validation)
- Signed Drug-Free Policy (document upload with digital signature capability)
- Results of All Drug Tests (document upload, if applicable)
- First Date of Employment (auto-populated when profile approved)
- Last Day of Employment (nullable field, updated when guard status changes)
- Continuing Education Records (document upload with expiry tracking)
- TOPS Profile Link (URL field with validation and direct access for managers)

**Validation Requirements:**
- Real-time field validation with clear error messaging
- Address validation using geocoding API
- SSN format validation (must be exactly 6 digits)
- File upload validation (PDF, JPG, PNG only, max 10MB per file)
- TOPS URL format validation (must be legitimate TOPS profile URL)
- Required field indicators with completion progress tracking

### AC2: Pre-populate Profile with AI-Parsed Resume Data
**Given** I have previously submitted an application with resume parsing  
**When** I access the profile creation form  
**Then** the system should automatically pre-populate available fields with AI-parsed data:

**Auto-Population Logic:**
- Full Legal Name from parsed resume contact information
- Address information from parsed resume contact details
- Work experience dates for employment history validation
- Education background for verification requirements
- Contact information consistency checks

**Data Review Interface:**
- Clear indication of auto-populated vs. manual fields
- Ability to review and modify all pre-populated information
- Confidence score display for AI-parsed data
- Manual override capability for all auto-populated fields

### AC3: Enable Profile Completion Assistance with OpenAI
**Given** I am filling out the guard profile form  
**When** I encounter incomplete or unclear field requirements  
**Then** the system should provide AI-powered completion assistance:

**AI Assistance Features:**
- Smart field completion suggestions based on partial input
- Validation of entered information for completeness and accuracy
- Automatic detection of missing required documentation
- Compliance requirement explanations for complex fields
- Real-time error correction suggestions

**Integration Requirements:**
- OpenAI API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- Secure data processing without permanent storage in OpenAI systems
- Fallback to manual completion if AI assistance is unavailable
- Privacy-compliant processing of sensitive information

### AC4: Implement Enhanced Document Management System
**Given** I need to upload required documents for TOPS compliance  
**When** I access the document upload section  
**Then** I should have access to a comprehensive document management system:

**Document Management Features:**
- Required document checklist with completion status indicators
- Multi-file upload capability with drag-and-drop interface
- Document type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG with size limits)
- Virus scanning integration for uploaded files
- Digital signature capability for policy agreements
- Document preview functionality before final submission

**Document Categories:**
- Government-issued photo ID
- Drug test results (if applicable)
- Educational certificates
- Security training certifications
- Policy acknowledgment documents
- TOPS-related documentation

**Expiry Tracking System:**
- Automatic document expiry date parsing
- Calendar reminders for renewal requirements (30, 14, 7 days)
- Status indicators for approaching expirations
- Renewal notification system

### AC5: TOPS Profile Integration
**Given** I have an existing TOPS profile or need to create one  
**When** I complete the TOPS profile section  
**Then** the system should provide comprehensive TOPS integration:

**TOPS Integration Features:**
- URL field for existing TOPS profile link with format validation
- Link validation to ensure it points to legitimate TOPS profile page
- Optional field indicator (guards may not have TOPS profile initially)
- Direct access button in manager interface to open TOPS profile in new tab
- TOPS profile creation guidance and requirements explanation

**Validation Requirements:**
- URL format validation (must be valid TOPS website URL)
- Link accessibility testing to ensure profile is publicly viewable
- Integration with Texas DPS TOPS system requirements
- Audit logging when TOPS profile links are accessed by managers

### AC6: Implement Encrypted Storage for Sensitive PII
**Given** I am entering sensitive personal information  
**When** I submit the guard profile form  
**Then** the system should securely encrypt and store all sensitive data:

**Encryption Requirements:**
- AES-256 encryption for SSN, DOB, and photograph data
- Role-based access restrictions (managers and admins only)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all PII access
- Data masking in user interfaces (show only last 4 digits of SSN)
- Secure key management through Supabase Vault

**Access Control:**
- Encrypted data fields only accessible to authorized roles
- Manager authentication required for PII access
- Audit trail for every access to encrypted fields
- Automatic session timeout for security-sensitive pages
