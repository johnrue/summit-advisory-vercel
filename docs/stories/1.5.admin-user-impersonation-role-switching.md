# Story 1.5: Admin User Impersonation & Role Switching

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** to switch between user roles and impersonate other users to troubleshoot issues and make necessary adjustments,
**so that** I can provide effective support and system administration without requiring separate admin-only interfaces for every function.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Role Switching Interface**: Create admin-only role switcher that allows switching between Admin, Manager, and Guard views
2. **User Impersonation System**: Enable admins to impersonate specific users (with their permission level) to troubleshoot account issues
3. **Audit Trail for Impersonation**: Log all impersonation sessions with start/end times, actions taken, and admin identity
4. **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI indicators when admin is in impersonation mode or switched role view
5. **Permission Preservation**: Ensure impersonated sessions respect the target user's actual permissions and data access
6. **Emergency Exit**: Always-available "Return to Admin" button/link during impersonation sessions
7. **Session Management**: Automatic logout from impersonation after configurable timeout (default 30 minutes)
8. **Impersonation Consent**: Notification system to inform users when their account has been accessed by admin (configurable)
9. **Role View Persistence**: Remember admin's preferred role view (but not impersonation) across sessions
10. **Dashboard Context Switching**: Seamlessly switch between admin, manager, and guard dashboard contexts without losing admin privileges

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Integration
From Stories 1.1-1.4 completion, the admin role view system builds upon:
- ✅ **Authentication Foundation**: Modern `@supabase/ssr` with JWT role extraction and session management
- ✅ **RBAC Infrastructure**: Comprehensive permission system with role hierarchy (client → guard → manager → admin)
- ✅ **Dashboard Framework**: Role-specific dashboards (Admin, Manager, Guard) with navigation
- ✅ **Permission System**: PermissionGate components and role-based UI control
- ✅ **Audit System**: Basic audit logging system ready for role view change tracking

**Key Technical Foundation from 1.1-1.4**:
- Role-specific dashboard pages for Admin, Manager, and Guard contexts
- Dashboard layout system with sidebar navigation and header components
- Permission-based component visibility and route protection
- localStorage-based user preferences (theme, display settings)
- Existing audit logging infrastructure for admin actions

### Data Models

**Simple Role View Switching**:
```typescript
interface AdminRoleViewState {
  adminUser: AuthUser;
  currentViewRole: UserRole;
  isViewingSwitchedRole: boolean;
  availableViewRoles: UserRole[];
  switchToRoleView: (role: UserRole) => void;
  returnToAdminView: () => void;
  roleViewPreferences: {
    defaultViewRole?: UserRole;
    rememberLastView: boolean;
  };
}

interface UserSupportContext {
  selectedUser: AuthUser | null;
  userPermissions: string[];
  isViewingUserContext: boolean;
  viewUserContext: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  exitUserContext: () => void;
}
```

### Simple Storage Requirements

**No New Database Tables Required** - Uses existing infrastructure:

**Role View Preferences (localStorage)**:
```typescript
interface AdminRoleViewPreferences {
  defaultViewRole?: UserRole;
  rememberLastView: boolean;
  lastViewRole?: UserRole;
  viewSwitchHistory: {
    role: UserRole;
    switchedAt: Date;
  }[];
}
```

**Basic Audit Enhancement (Optional)**:
```sql
-- Simple extension to existing audit_logs table for role view switching
ALTER TABLE public.audit_logs 
ADD COLUMN role_view_switch JSONB;

-- No additional indexes needed - uses existing audit infrastructure
```

### API Specifications

**Simple Admin Support API**:
```typescript
// POST /api/v1/admin/role-view/switch
interface RoleViewSwitchRequest {
  targetViewRole: UserRole;
  persistPreference?: boolean;
}

interface RoleViewSwitchResponse {
  currentViewRole: UserRole;
  adminRole: UserRole;
  success: boolean;
}

// GET /api/v1/admin/user-support/{userId}
interface UserSupportInfoRequest {
  userId: string;
}

interface UserSupportInfoResponse {
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    role: UserRole;
    permissions: string[];
    lastActive: Date;
  };
  canView: boolean;
}
```

### Component Specifications

**Simple Admin Control Components**:
```typescript
// Admin role view switcher
interface AdminRoleViewSwitcherProps {
  currentViewRole: UserRole;
  adminRole: UserRole;
  availableViewRoles: UserRole[];
  onViewRoleSwitch: (role: UserRole) => void;
  onReturnToAdminView: () => void;
  className?: string;
}

// User support information viewer
interface UserSupportViewerProps {
  userId: string;
  user: AuthUser;
  onViewUserSupport: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  onExitUserSupport: () => void;
  isViewingUserSupport: boolean;
  className?: string;
}

// Simple role view indicator
interface RoleViewIndicatorProps {
  currentViewRole: UserRole;
  adminRole: UserRole;
  isViewingSwitchedRole: boolean;
  onReturnToAdmin: () => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

**Enhanced Admin Pages**:
- Enhanced `/app/dashboard/(admin)/user-management/page.tsx` - Add user support tools

### Security Considerations

**Simple Access Control**:
- Only users with `system.manage_roles` permission can access role view switching
- Role view switching is UI-only - admin retains admin privileges at all times
- Basic audit logging for role view changes with admin identity
- No security risks - admin never actually accesses other user accounts

**Safe Implementation**:
- localStorage-based preferences with no sensitive data
- Read-only user support tools with no data modification
- Admin always maintains full admin permissions and access
- No user account access or impersonation - purely view switching

### Technical Constraints

**Simple Performance Requirements**:
- Role view switching should be instantaneous (<100ms)
- localStorage preference loading should be immediate
- User support information loading should be <500ms

**Integration Constraints**:
- Must work with existing dashboard layout and navigation
- Compatible with existing role-based components
- Uses existing auth context and permission system
- Preserves existing audit logging patterns

**Implementation Constraints**:
- No new database tables or complex schemas required
- No session management or timeout handling needed
- No notification system or user consent required
- Admin always retains full admin privileges and permissions

### Testing Requirements

**Basic Security Testing**:
- Verify admin role view switching doesn't affect actual permissions
- Test that admin always retains admin privileges during view switching
- Validate user support tools are read-only and safe

**Integration Testing**:
- Role view switching across all dashboard contexts
- Dashboard navigation and context preservation
- Return to admin view functionality

**User Experience Testing**:
- Dashboard context switching without data loss
- Visual indicator clarity and accessibility
- Mobile responsiveness for role view controls
