## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From completed Story 4.5 (Data Export & Reporting Dashboard):
- Comprehensive reporting system successfully implemented with real-time Supabase updates
- API endpoints following `/api/v1/` pattern established and working
- Component structure using admin/manager route groups proven effective
- Email delivery system using Resend integration already implemented and functional
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright, pgTAP) configured and ready

### Data Models
**Existing Consultation System** [Source: lib/consultation-service.ts]:
- `consultation_requests` table with fields: first_name, last_name, email, phone, service_type, message, status
- Established patterns for form validation, database insertion, and error handling
- Existing service types: armed, unarmed, event, executive, commercial, consulting, other
- Status workflow: new → contacted → scheduled → completed → cancelled

**Extended Lead Management Schema** [Source: data-models-and-schema-changes.md#hiring-pipeline]:
- New `client_leads` table extending consultation_requests pattern for comprehensive lead management
- Lead source tracking with ENUM values for consistent categorization
- Lead assignment with foreign key to user_roles for manager tracking
- Lead status pipeline: prospect → contacted → qualified → proposal → negotiation → won/lost
- JSONB fields for flexible source-specific data storage

**Key Database Relationships** [Source: data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]:
- All tables use UUID primary keys with B-tree indexes for performance
- Foreign key relationships with user_roles table for assignment tracking
- Integration with existing notification system for manager alerts

### API Specifications  
**Lead Management APIs** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#guard-management-apis]:
- `POST /api/v1/leads/capture` - Multi-source lead submission with validation
- `GET /api/v1/leads` - Lead listing with role-based filtering and pagination
- `PUT /api/v1/leads/:id/assign` - Lead assignment with notification triggering
- `POST /api/v1/leads/bulk-import` - CSV/Excel lead import with deduplication

**Authentication & Authorization** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]:
- Supabase JWT tokens with custom claims for RBAC implementation
- Manager role access required for lead management functionality
- Lead assignment restricted by territory and availability rules

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout System** [Source: component-architecture.md#dashboard-layout-system]:
- Extends existing `app/dashboard/(manager)/` route group structure
- Uses `useAuth()` hook for role-based access controls
- `<ProtectedRoute>` authorization wrapper for manager-only lead access
- Real-time updates using `useRealTimeNotifications()` for lead assignments

**Kanban Workflow Components** [Source: component-architecture.md#kanban-workflow-components]:
- Leverages existing @dnd-kit drag-and-drop components from Story 4.5
- Built on shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, Badge components for consistency
- Real-time collaboration using Supabase subscriptions

### File Locations
**Component Structure** [Source: source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]:
- Main dashboard: `app/dashboard/(manager)/leads/page.tsx` (manager route group)
- Lead capture: `app/dashboard/(manager)/leads/capture/page.tsx`
- Lead components: `components/dashboard/leads/` directory
- API endpoints: `app/api/v1/leads/` following existing v1 pattern
- Services: `lib/services/lead-management-service.ts`, `lib/services/lead-assignment-service.ts`

**Naming Conventions** [Source: source-tree-integration.md#integration-guidelines]:
- Components: PascalCase.tsx (LeadsDashboard.tsx, LeadCaptureForm.tsx)
- Services: kebab-case.ts (lead-management-service.ts, lead-assignment-service.ts)
- All imports use @/ prefix for consistency with existing patterns

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements]:
- Unit tests in `__tests__/` directories co-located with components
- Jest + React Testing Library (Next.js standard framework)
- 95% coverage target for business logic, 85% for UI components
- Database tests using pgTAP for lead schema and RLS policies
- Integration tests using Playwright for end-to-end lead workflows

**CI/CD Pipeline** [Source: testing-strategy.md#cicd-testing-pipeline]:
- GitHub Actions workflow with database tests, unit tests, and e2e tests
- Performance testing for lead assignment algorithms required
- Security testing for lead data access controls mandatory

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]:
- Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router (hybrid static/dynamic routing)
- React 19 with TypeScript 5 for comprehensive type safety
- Supabase client 2.50.5 with RLS performance optimization
- Existing Resend 6.0.1 for email delivery system
- Node.js 22.17.0 LTS deployment on Vercel serverless functions

**Existing Integration Patterns** [Source: lib/consultation-service.ts]:
- Form validation patterns: email regex, required field checking
- Database insertion patterns: error handling, data transformation
- Service response patterns: ApiResponse<T> with success/error structure
- TypeScript interfaces: ConsultationFormData, ConsultationRequest patterns

**Security Requirements** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]:
- All lead data requires appropriate RBAC permissions (Manager/Admin roles)
- Audit logging mandatory for lead assignment and status changes
- Email/phone data requires appropriate privacy handling
- Lead assignment restricted by territory and availability rules

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths and component locations align with the defined architecture in `source-tree-integration.md`. The manager route group pattern places lead management in the correct location for role-based access control. Services extend the established consultation-service.ts patterns, and the component hierarchy leverages existing dashboard structure from Story 4.5.

**Integration with Existing Systems**:
- Extends current consultation_requests table and service patterns
- Reuses notification system infrastructure from completed stories
- Leverages existing Resend email integration for automated workflows
- Utilizes established API endpoint patterns and authentication flows
