# Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to extend the existing Summit Advisory Next.js application with authentication capabilities,
**so that** the platform can support secure guard management features while preserving marketing site functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend existing Next.js 15 application with Supabase Auth integration while maintaining optimal performance for marketing pages
2. Configure role-based routing that preserves public marketing routes and protects guard management routes
3. Implement environment variable management for development, staging, and production environments
4. Set up Vercel deployment pipeline extension to handle authenticated and static content deployment
5. Create database schema foundation with RLS policies template structure
6. Establish testing framework for both static and authenticated application components

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the foundation story for the entire Guard Management Platform.

### Data Models
**User Roles & Permissions (RBAC)** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#user-roles-permissions-rbac]
- Table: `user_roles` with UUID primary key and B-tree index
- Fields: `user_id` (FK to auth.users), `role` ENUM('admin', 'manager', 'guard', 'client'), `permissions` JSONB
- Relationships: One-to-many with auth.users, one-to-many with guards, shifts, audit logs
- RLS policies required for role-based data access enforcement

### API Specifications
**Authentication Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]
- JWT Decode 4.0.0 for custom claims extraction required for RBAC implementation
- Client-side token parsing for role determination
- Integration with existing Supabase client configuration pattern

### Component Specifications
**Route Group Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
- Use Next.js route groups: `(marketing)`, `(auth)`, dashboard with nested `(admin)`, `(manager)`, `(guard)`
- Component naming: PascalCase.tsx (e.g., GuardProfileForm.tsx)
- Barrel exports in each major directory for clean imports
- Path aliases using @/ prefix consistent with existing pattern

### File Locations
**Enhanced App Router Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
- `/app/(marketing)/` - public marketing pages (move existing pages here)
- `/app/(auth)/` - authentication pages (login, register)
- `/app/dashboard/` - guard management routes with role-based sub-routes
- `/app/api/v1/` - versioned API routes for guard management
- `/lib/auth/` - authentication services and utilities
- `/components/dashboard/` - dashboard-specific components

### Technical Constraints
**Deployment Strategy** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#enhancement-deployment-strategy]
- Unified Vercel Platform: Single deployment target for both marketing and guard management
- Single Supabase project with expanded schema
- Route-based traffic splitting between platforms
- GitHub Actions integrated with Vercel deployment

**Backward Compatibility Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
- All existing queries must continue to work unchanged
- Marketing functionality completely isolated from guard management schema
- No breaking changes to current API endpoints or database structure
- Consultation_requests table remains untouched

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements]
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library (Next.js standard)
- Location: `__tests__/` directories co-located with components
- Coverage: 95% for business logic, 85% for UI components
- Database tests: pgTAP with Supabase CLI integration in `supabase/tests/database/`
- E2E tests: Playwright for complete workflows
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline with automated testing

**Test File Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-with-existing-tests]
- Create `tests/` directory with unit, integration, and database test folders
- Co-locate component tests in `__tests__/` directories
- Target 90%+ coverage for critical workflows

## Testing
### Test Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library in `__tests__/` directories
- **Database Tests**: pgTAP framework in `supabase/tests/database/`
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for complete authentication workflows
- **Coverage Requirements**: 95% business logic, 85% UI components
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions pipeline runs full test suite on every PR
