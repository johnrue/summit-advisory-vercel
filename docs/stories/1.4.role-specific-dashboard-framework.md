## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 completion, the simple dashboard foundation is established:
- ✅ **Basic Dashboard Layout**: `/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` with sidebar navigation and header components
- ✅ **Role-Based Navigation**: `/components/dashboard/sidebar-navigation.tsx` with permission-driven menu visibility
- ✅ **Permission System**: `<PermissionGate>` components and RBAC integration for content visibility
- ✅ **Authentication Foundation**: JWT role extraction, session management, and user context providers
- ✅ **Responsive Framework**: Collapsible sidebar navigation with mobile-first design patterns
- ✅ **Security Foundation**: RLS policies with role hierarchy and basic audit logging

**Key Technical Foundation from 1.1-1.3**:
- Modern `@supabase/ssr` package with auth integration
- Role hierarchy: Client(1) → Guard(2) → Manager(3) → Admin(4)
- Permission checking: `hasPermission`, `hasAnyRole`, `canAccessRoute`
- Error handling with `AuthErrorBoundary` components
- TypeScript strict mode with type safety throughout authentication system

### Data Models

**Dashboard Content Structure** [No new database tables required]:
```typescript
interface DashboardSection {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: React.ReactNode;
  permissions: string[];
  isVisible: boolean;
  mobileOptimized?: boolean;
}

interface RoleDashboard {
  role: UserRole;
  sections: DashboardSection[];
  quickActions?: {
    label: string;
    href: string;
    permission: string;
  }[];
}
```

**Simple User Preferences** [localStorage-based]:
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  viewMode: 'compact' | 'comfortable';
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean;
}
```
