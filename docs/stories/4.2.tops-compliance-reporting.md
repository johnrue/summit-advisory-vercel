# Story 4.2: TOPS Compliance Reporting

## Status
âœ… **Ready for Review** - Implementation complete, awaiting QA validation

## Story
**As a** manager,
**I want** to generate TOPS-compliant reports with all required guard information,

2. Implement automated report generation triggered by date ranges and compliance deadlines
3. Configure sensitive data masking in reports based on user role permissions (SSN visible only to Manager/Admin)
4. Create exportable report formats (PDF, CSV) with official letterhead and compliance attestations
5. Implement report scheduling system with automatic delivery to compliance stakeholders
6. Configure report audit trail tracking who generated reports and when for accountability
