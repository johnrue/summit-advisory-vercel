## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1 and 1.2 completion, the RBAC foundation is already comprehensively established:
- ✅ **Core Database Schema**: `user_roles` table with ENUM roles, permissions JSONB, complete audit logging
- ✅ **RLS Security Framework**: Production-ready policies for role-based data access enforcement
- ✅ **Role Management Services**: Client (`role-service.ts`) and server (`role-service-server.ts`) services with full CRUD operations
- ✅ **React Integration**: `useUserRole` hook with JWT token parsing, database fallback, and permission checking
- ✅ **Route Protection**: `<ProtectedRoute>` components with role-based access control and convenience wrappers
- ✅ **Authentication Integration**: Complete JWT token handling with role extraction and secure session management

**Key Technical Architecture from 1.1/1.2**:
- Modern `@supabase/ssr` package with SSR/client patterns
- Role hierarchy system: client(1) → guard(2) → manager(3) → admin(4)
- Comprehensive permission checking: `hasPermission`, `hasAnyRole`, `canAccessRoute`
- Production-safe error handling and logging
- TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety throughout

### Data Models
**User Roles & Permissions (RBAC)** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#user-roles-permissions-rbac]
- Table: `user_roles` with UUID primary key and B-tree index (implemented in Story 1.1)
- Fields: `user_id` (FK to auth.users), `role` ENUM('admin', 'manager', 'guard', 'client'), `permissions` JSONB
- Relationships: One-to-many with auth.users, guards, shifts, audit logs
- RLS policies: Complete enforcement for role-based data access (implemented in Story 1.1)
- Audit logging: Full audit trail with `audit_logs` table for role changes and permission tracking

**Core Permission Matrix Structure**:
```typescript
interface PermissionMatrix {
  role: UserRole;
  permissions: {
    // User Management
    users: {
      view_all: boolean;        // Admin: true, Manager: subordinates, Guard: false
      create: boolean;          // Admin: true, Manager: false, Guard: false
      edit: boolean;            // Admin: true, Manager: subordinates, Guard: self
    };
    // Guard Management  
    guards: {
      view_all: boolean;        // Admin: true, Manager: assigned, Guard: false
      edit_profiles: boolean;   // Admin: true, Manager: assigned, Guard: self
    };
    // System Administration
    system: {
      view_audit_logs: boolean; // Admin: true, Manager: false, Guard: false
      manage_roles: boolean;    // Admin: true, Manager: false, Guard: false
    };
  };
}
```
