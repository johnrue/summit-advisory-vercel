## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story being prepared for the Guard Management Platform.

### Data Models
**Reports & Analytics Schema** [Source: data-models-and-schema-changes.md#new-data-models]:
- Guards table with `status`, `license_expiry`, `certifications` JSONB for compliance reporting
- Applications table with `pipeline_stage`, `ai_parsed_data` for hiring conversion metrics  
- Shifts table with `time_range` TSTZRANGE, `status` for scheduling efficiency analysis
- User_roles table with RBAC permissions for access control on sensitive data
- Audit_logs table for comprehensive compliance audit trails

**Key Database Relationships** [Source: data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]:
- All tables use UUID primary keys with B-tree indexes for performance
- 25+ strategic indexes following performance advisor recommendations
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage (certifications, requirements, parsed data)

### API Specifications  
**Report Generation APIs** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#new-api-endpoints]:
- `GET /api/v1/reports/metrics` - Fetch operational metrics with role-based filtering
- `POST /api/v1/exports/generate` - Generate data exports with format/date filtering
- `GET /api/v1/reports/scheduled` - Manage automated report scheduling
- `POST /api/v1/reports/custom` - Execute custom report queries with permission validation

**Authentication & Authorization** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]:
- Supabase JWT tokens with custom claims for RBAC implementation
- Semantic API versioning with `/api/v1/` pattern for backward compatibility
- Security-first design with audit logging for all sensitive operations

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout System** [Source: component-architecture.md#dashboard-layout-system]:
- Extends existing `app/layout.tsx` patterns with authentication boundaries
- `useAuth()` enhanced authentication hook with role-based access controls
- `<ProtectedRoute>` authorization wrapper for admin-only report access
- Real-time updates using `useRealTimeNotifications()` hook

**Chart Components** [Source: component-architecture.md#new-components]:
- React Big Calendar for visualization following existing date-fns patterns  
- Built on shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, Button components for consistency
- Recharts integration for analytics visualization (already in existing dependencies)

### File Locations
**Component Structure** [Source: source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]:
- Main dashboard: `app/dashboard/(admin)/reports/page.tsx` (admin route group)
- Report components: `components/dashboard/` and `components/charts/` 
- API endpoints: `app/api/v1/reports/` and `app/api/v1/exports/`
- Services: `lib/services/report-service.ts`, `lib/services/data-export-service.ts`

**Naming Conventions** [Source: source-tree-integration.md#integration-guidelines]:
- Components: PascalCase.tsx (ReportsDashboard.tsx, MetricsChart.tsx)
- Services: kebab-case.ts (data-export-service.ts, report-scheduling-service.ts)
- All imports use @/ prefix for consistency with existing patterns

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements]:
- Unit tests in `__tests__/` directories co-located with components
- Jest + React Testing Library (Next.js standard framework)
- 95% coverage target for business logic, 85% for UI components
- Database tests using pgTAP in `supabase/tests/database/` for RLS policies
- Integration tests using Playwright for end-to-end report workflows

**CI/CD Pipeline** [Source: testing-strategy.md#cicd-testing-pipeline]:
- GitHub Actions workflow with database tests, unit tests, and e2e tests
- Performance testing for large dataset exports required
- Security testing for access control implementation mandatory

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]:
- Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router (hybrid static/dynamic routing)
- React 19 with TypeScript 5 for comprehensive type safety
- Supabase client 2.50.5 with RLS performance optimization
- Existing Recharts dependency for analytics visualization
- Node.js 22.17.0 LTS deployment on Vercel serverless functions

**Security Requirements** [Source: api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]:
- All sensitive data exports require appropriate RBAC permissions
- Audit logging mandatory for report generation and data export activities
- Data masking based on user role permissions (SSN visible only to Manager/Admin)
- OAuth 2.0 integration patterns following existing calendar API standards

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths and component locations align with the defined architecture in `source-tree-integration.md`. The admin route group pattern places reporting dashboard in the correct location for role-based access control. Services follow the established kebab-case naming convention, and the component hierarchy leverages existing shadcn/ui patterns for consistency.
