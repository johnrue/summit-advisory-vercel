# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-26)

## Story
**As a** manager or guard,
**I want** to securely log into the platform with appropriate access levels,
**so that** I can access role-specific functionality while ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Supabase Auth login/logout with email and password authentication
2. Configure password policy with minimum complexity requirements and rate limiting
3. Create role assignment system (Guard, Manager, Admin) with Supabase RLS integration
4. Implement session management with secure token handling and automatic logout
5. Provide password reset functionality with secure email verification flow

**Note**: MFA enforcement will be added in a future enhancement phase after initial development and testing is complete.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion, the authentication infrastructure foundation is already established:
- ✅ **Authentication Infrastructure**: Modern @supabase/ssr package integrated with SSR/client patterns
- ✅ **Route Structure**: `(auth)` route group created with login/register page stubs
- ✅ **Database Foundation**: `user_roles` table exists with proper RLS policies
- ✅ **Protection Components**: `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthErrorBoundary` components available
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Jest + Playwright configured with authentication test utilities

**Key Technical Decisions from 1.1**: 
- Used modern `@supabase/ssr` package instead of legacy auth-helpers
- Implemented Suspense boundaries for `useSearchParams` to prevent hydration issues
- Fixed module naming: "moduleNameMapper" (not "moduleNameMapping") in Jest config
- Default vs named export consistency maintained across auth components

### Data Models
**User Roles & Permissions (RBAC)** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#user-roles-permissions-rbac]
- Table: `user_roles` with UUID primary key and B-tree index (already created in Story 1.1)
- Fields: `user_id` (FK to auth.users), `role` ENUM('admin', 'manager', 'guard', 'client'), `permissions` JSONB
- Relationships: One-to-many with auth.users, one-to-many with guards, shifts, audit logs
- RLS policies already configured for role-based data access enforcement

**Guards Management Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#guards-management]
- Optional Auth Link: `user_id` field optionally links to `auth.users` for guards who access the system
- Self-contained: Guards can exist without system access (contractors, etc.)

### API Specifications
**Authentication Strategy** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#api-integration-strategy]
- Supabase JWT tokens with custom claims for RBAC
- API versioning with `/api/v1/` prefix (already established)
- Layered serverless architecture with security-first design

**JWT Token Handling** [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]
- JWT Decode 4.0.0 for custom claims extraction required for RBAC implementation
- Client-side token parsing for role determination
- Integration with existing Supabase client configuration pattern

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout System** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#dashboard-layout-system]
- Core Hook: `useAuth()` - Enhanced authentication hook with role-based access (foundation exists from 1.1)
- Protection Component: `<ProtectedRoute>` - Authorization wrapper component (created in 1.1)
- Integration: Extends existing layout.tsx patterns with authentication boundaries

**Authentication Gateway** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#component-interaction-diagram]
- Acts as bridge between static marketing site and authenticated guard management routes
- Role-based routing to Admin, Manager, or Guard dashboards

### File Locations
**Authentication Route Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
- `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login page (stub exists from 1.1)
- `/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Guard registration (stub exists from 1.1)  
- `/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Password reset (to be created)
- `/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Auth layout with AuthProvider (created in 1.1)

**Service Layer Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
- `/lib/auth/supabase.ts` - Client-side Supabase client (created in 1.1)

- `/lib/auth/auth-service.ts` - Authentication business logic (to be created)
- `/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx` - React auth context provider (created in 1.1)

**Component Naming** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#integration-guidelines]
- Components: PascalCase.tsx (LoginForm.tsx, PasswordResetForm.tsx)
- Services: kebab-case.ts (auth-service.ts)
- Hooks: use-kebab-case.ts (use-auth.ts - exists)

### Technical Constraints

**Infrastructure Integration** [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#enhancement-deployment-strategy]
- Deployment: Unified Vercel approach for entire application (marketing + auth)
- Environment variables: Unified Supabase configuration across both platforms
- Session handling: Must work across both deployment environments
