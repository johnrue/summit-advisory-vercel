## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Additions
```sql
-- Certification tracking table
CREATE TABLE guard_certifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  guard_id UUID REFERENCES guards(id) NOT NULL,
  certification_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- 'TOPS License', 'CPR', 'First Aid', etc.
  certificate_number VARCHAR(100),
  issued_date DATE,
  expiry_date DATE NOT NULL,
  issuing_authority VARCHAR(200),
  document_url TEXT, -- Stored in Vercel Blob
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active', -- 'active', 'expired', 'pending_renewal'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Certification history for renewals
CREATE TABLE certification_history (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  guard_certification_id UUID REFERENCES guard_certifications(id) NOT NULL,
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'issued', 'renewed', 'expired', 'revoked'
  previous_expiry_date DATE,
  new_expiry_date DATE,
  document_url TEXT,
  processed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_guard_certifications_guard_id ON guard_certifications(guard_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_guard_certifications_expiry_date ON guard_certifications(expiry_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_certification_history_certification_id ON certification_history(guard_certification_id);
```

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `lib/services/certification-monitoring-service.ts` - Main monitoring and alert service
- `lib/services/certification-renewal-service.ts` - Renewal workflow management
- `components/guards/certification-renewal.tsx` - Renewal interface for guards
- `components/admin/certification-dashboard.tsx` - Compliance dashboard
- `app/api/certifications/route.ts` - Certification management API
- `lib/jobs/certification-monitoring-job.ts` - Scheduled monitoring job

### Service Pattern
```typescript
// Monitor certification expiries
const expiringCerts = await certificationMonitoringService.checkExpirations()

// Start renewal process
await certificationRenewalService.initiateRenewal({
  certificationId: cert.id,
  guardId: guard.id,
  documentFile: uploadedFile
})

// Check if guard can be scheduled
const canSchedule = await certificationService.canGuardBeScheduled(guardId)
```

### Alert Timing Strategy
- **30 days**: Initial reminder to guard with renewal instructions
- **14 days**: Escalated reminder to guard + manager notification
- **7 days**: Urgent alert to guard + manager + automatic scheduling restriction
- **0 days**: Certification expired, full scheduling block, escalation to compliance

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for monitoring service and expiry calculations
- Integration tests with guard and shift management systems
- Manual testing of renewal workflow and document upload
- Test scheduled job execution and alert delivery

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: CertificationMonitoringService, renewal workflow logic
- **Integration Tests**: Scheduling restrictions, notification delivery
- **Manual Testing**: Dashboard interface, renewal process, alert timing
