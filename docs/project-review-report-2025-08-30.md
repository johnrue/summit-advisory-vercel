# Project Review Report - 2025-08-30 (Detailed)

This report provides a detailed analysis of the project, conducted on August 30, 2025. It includes specific findings regarding story completion, mock data usage, and code compliance to provide actionable insights for the development team.

## 1. Story Completion Status

All user stories documented in the `/docs/stories` directory are marked as complete or ready for review. From a project management and documentation perspective, all planned features appear to have been implemented.

## 2. Mock Data and Placeholder Usage

The review identified extensive use of mock data and placeholders. While UI placeholders are acceptable, the hardcoded mock data needs to be replaced with live data integrations.

### 2.1. Hardcoded Mock Data (Requires Action)

This data is used for component rendering and API responses, indicating a lack of connection to the live backend.

*   **`app/api/certifications/route.ts`**
    *   L67: `// For now, return a placeholder response`
*   **`app/api/compliance-reports/route.ts`**
    *   L151: `// For now, return mock data`
    *   L152: `const mockReports = [`
*   **`app/api/v1/applications/submit/route.ts`**
    *   L120: `// Placeholder implementation`
*   **`app/api/v1/calendar/subscriptions/route.ts`**
    *   L16: `// Mock implementation - in reality would validate JWT`
*   **`app/api/v1/guards/my-availability/route.ts`**
    *   L11: `// Extract guard ID from JWT (placeholder - would be implemented with auth middleware)`
*   **`app/api/v1/shifts/bulk-actions/route.ts`**
    *   L152: `// For now, return a placeholder response since we don't have persistent storage for operations`
*   **`app/dashboard/(admin)/role-management/components/RoleAssignmentTable.tsx`**
    *   L77: `email: `user-${roleRecord.user_id.slice(0, 8)}@example.com`, // Placeholder email`
*   **`app/dashboard/(guard)/profile/create/page.tsx`**
    *   L105: `const mockData = {`
*   **`app/dashboard/(manager)/guards/profiles/page.tsx`**
    *   L87: `// Mock data - in real implementation, use guardProfileService.searchProfiles`
    *   L88: `const mockProfiles: GuardProfileSummary[] = [`
*   **`app/dashboard/(manager)/hiring/approve/[id]/page.tsx`**
    *   L88: `const mockApplication: HiringApplication = {`
*   **`components/admin/compliance-reports.tsx`**
    *   L37: `// Mock data for recent reports`
    *   L57: `// Mock data for scheduled reports`
*   **`components/comments/CommentEditor.tsx`**
    *   L226: `//{ Mock users - in real implementation, this would be dynamic }`
*   **`components/dashboard/kanban/KanbanAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`**
    *   L92: `const mockData: AnalyticsData = {`
*   **`components/dashboard/reports/metrics-overview.tsx`**
    *   L42: `// Mock data - replace with real API calls`
*   **`components/dashboard/reports/reports-audit-log.tsx`**
    *   L34: `const mockAuditLogs: AuditLogEntry[] = [`
*   **`components/dashboard/shifts/ShiftCloneDialog.tsx`**
    *   L42: `// Mock client data - in real implementation, this would come from API`
*   **`components/dashboard/shifts/ShiftCreateForm.tsx`**
    *   L91: `// Mock data for form options`
*   **`components/interviews/CalendarSubscriptionManager.tsx`**
    *   L98: `'Authorization': 'Bearer mock-token' // This would be real auth token`
*   **`components/interviews/InterviewAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`**
    *   L187: `// Top interviewers (mocked data - would come from user table in real implementation)`
*   **`components/profiles/GuardProfileApprovalInterface.tsx`**
    *   L114: `// Get current user ID (mock for now)`

### 2.2. UI Placeholders (Acceptable)

These are standard UI placeholders to guide user input and can be ignored.

*   `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`: L112
*   `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`: L112, L133
*   `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`: L101, L119, L140, L160, L185, L240
*   `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`: L121, L176
*   And many others in form components...

## 3. TypeScript Errors

The TypeScript compiler reported a large number of errors, indicating significant issues with type safety and code correctness. Below is a file-by-file breakdown of all errors found.

**Summary of Error Types:**
*   **TS2344 (Type Constraint):** Many API routes have incorrect type definitions for route parameters.
*   **TS2561 / TS2353 (Unknown Properties):** Objects are being created with properties not defined in their types.
*   **TS2322 (Type Mismatch):** Widespread type incompatibilities.
*   **TS2339 (Property Does Not Exist):** Accessing properties that are not part of an object's type definition.
*   **TS2305 / TS2724 (Module Export):** Incorrect imports or exports.
*   **TS7006 (Implicit Any):** Function parameters without explicit types.
*   **TS2307 (Module Not Found):** Missing dependencies or incorrect paths.

### Errors in `.next/types/` (Generated Files)

These errors indicate underlying issues in the source API route files (`app/api/...`).

*   **`.next/types/app/api/v1/admin/user-support/[userId]/permissions/route.ts`**: L49
*   **`.next/types/app/api/v1/admin/user-support/[userId]/route.ts`**: L49
*   **`.next/types/app/api/v1/applications/[id]/ai-review/route.ts`**: L166
*   ...and 24 more similar errors in other generated route files.

### Errors in `__tests__/`

A large number of errors are located in the test files, rendering the test suite non-functional.

*   **`__tests__/admin/use-admin-role-view.test.tsx`**: 4 errors (TS2561, TS2345)
*   **`__tests__/analytics/conversion-tracking.test.ts`**: 26 errors (TS2353, TS2322, TS2367, TS2339, TS7006)
*   **`__tests__/api/v1/calendar/oauth-connect.test.ts`**: 12 errors (TS2353)
*   **`__tests__/approval/approval-components.test.tsx`**: 30 errors (TS2339)
*   **`__tests__/approval/approval-workflow-service.test.ts`**: 16 errors (TS2345, TS2339, TS2322)
*   **`__tests__/approval/audit-trail-service.test.ts`**: 14 errors (TS2305, TS2724, TS2345, TS2339)
*   ...and many more across the entire test suite.

### Errors in `app/`

*   **`app/api/notifications/preferences/route.ts`**: L66 (TS2322)
*   **`app/api/test/ai-parse-file/route.ts`**: L158 (TS2345)
*   **`app/api/unified-leads/analytics/route.ts`**: L27, L28, L30, L31 (TS2322)
*   ...and many more.

### Errors in `components/`

*   **`components/dashboard/availability/GuardAvailabilityCalendar.tsx`**: Multiple errors (TS2307, TS2305, TS2367)
*   **`components/dashboard/shifts/ShiftEditForm.tsx`**: Multiple errors (TS2322, TS2769, TS2345)
*   ...and many more.

### Errors in `lib/`

*   **`lib/services/ab-testing-service.ts`**: L39, L67, L400, L409 (TS2571, TS2322, TS7006)
*   **`lib/services/conflict-detection-service.ts`**: Multiple errors (TS2339, TS2345)
*   ...and many more.

*(Note: A full, unabridged list of all ~400 errors would be too long for this report, but the developer can run `npm run type-check` to see them all. The examples above are representative of the issues found.)*

## 4. Recommendations

Given the state of the project, the following steps are recommended to bring it to a stable, production-ready state:

1.  **Halt New Feature Development**: No new features should be added until the existing codebase is stabilized.

2.  **Prioritize TypeScript Error Resolution**: The type errors are the most critical issue. A systematic approach is required:
    *   **Start with Type Definitions**: Review and correct all type definitions in `lib/types/`. Many errors stem from incorrect or incomplete types.
    *   **Fix Services**: Address errors in the `lib/services/` directory. Correcting the business logic layer is crucial.
    *   **Repair API Routes**: Fix the type issues in `app/api/`. This will also resolve the errors seen in the `.next/types/` directory.
    *   **Address Component Errors**: Once services and types are stable, fix the errors in the `components/` and `app/dashboard/` directories.
    *   **Fix the Test Suite**: The test suite is unusable in its current state. Fixing the tests in `__tests__/` is essential to create a safety net for further refactoring.

3.  **Replace Mock Data**: After the codebase is type-safe and the tests are passing, begin replacing all hardcoded mock data with live API calls to the Supabase backend.

4.  **Full Regression Test**: Once the above steps are complete, perform a full manual and automated regression test of the entire application to ensure all functionality works as expected.

This project requires a significant, focused effort on stabilization and refactoring before it can be considered for production deployment.
